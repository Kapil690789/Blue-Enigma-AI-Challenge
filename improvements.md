Upgraded LLM and Embedding Models: Mention the switch from OpenAI models to Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash and the text-embedding-004 model, noting potential improvements in speed, cost, and quality.

Enhanced User Experience: Discuss the implementation of streaming responses for real-time feedback and conversation history for contextual, multi-turn dialogues.

Bonus: Interactive Web UI: If you build the Streamlit app, describe how it significantly improves usability and showcases your ability to build user-facing applications.
